# Build the Kubernetes cluster

## 1. Sign into Google Cloud

Open a command shell. 

Sign into your Google Cloud account (need Google SDK [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/))

The following command will open up a browser window to authenticate using your Gsuite account associated with the Google Cloud.

```
$ gcloud auth login
```

## 2. Provision Cluster

Find the project ID

![Image of Google Cloud Dashboard](http://i.imgur.com/WRXSKt4.png)

Run the command to create a 3-node cluster on Google cloud. 

```
$ gcloud container clusters create k8strainingcluster
```
 

## 3. Connect with Cluster

Install kubectl

```
gcloud components install kubectl
```

Get credentials

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Configure kubectl with the training cluster context.

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials k8strainingcluster
```

Verify kubectl can connect to the cluster

```
kubectl cluster-info
```

Start proxy to connect to the Kubernetes cluster. This command authenticates you with the Kubernetes API server. 

```
kubectl proxy
```
Note you can only run the Kubernetes Dashboard (official UI) on the machine in which you run this command. It won't work on remote machine.  

Open the Dashboard in browser with the following IP URL

```
127.0.0.1:8001/ui
```

Would accessing the Dashboard be the same on other instances of Kubernetes - e.g. not public cloud? Yes, but you can also access the Dashboard in other ways, including 

```
https://<IP of master node>/ui"
```

On GKE you will be prompted for a username and a password to access the Dashboard UI. The username is admin and the password is automatically generated. To retrieve it, run the following command and look for it in the resulting YAML output:

```
gcloud container clusters describe k8strainingcluster
```

## 4. Run "Hello World"

Deploy "hello world" application to get something up and running on your new cluster

```
kubectl run hello-world --replicas=5 --labels="run=load-balancer-example" --image=gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0  --port=8080
```

## 4a. Expose the hello-world app 

Expose the container. Note that the type="LoadBalancer option in kubectl requests that Google Cloud Platform provision a load balancer for your container, which is billed per the regular Load Balancer pricing.

```
kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type="LoadBalancer"
```

## 4b. Get the ip address

```
kubectl get service hello-node
```
## 4c. Access the app

http://EXTERNAL-IP:8080

## 5. Tour of Dashboard (the official UI of Kubernetes)

Instructor will give a tour of the Kubernetes Dashboard

## 6. Open New Command Line

To continue to use the CLI, open a new command prompt with the proxy running in the other one.
